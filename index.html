                 When you buy a Fox, you aren’t simply buying an ordinary avatar or even a piece of art. You are gaining membership access to the Grand Lodge with the all holder-only benefits. Your Fox represents your digital identity and opens digital doors for you.

             <p class="articleText">
                 Every Fox holder, which we call Foxon, will have a voting-power proportional to the amount of NFTs on the wallet. You can use this voting power in order to participate in all key project decisions such as the election of the government, use of the budget and etc. Every Foxon can create their own team or join an existing one to participate in the government elections. You can find out more info about applying to elections on our discord server.

                 3 Wadjets can come together to merge themselves into Magister - the highest stage of Foxon development. Because of their power, magisters are the most respected Foxons in the lodge, and thats why they have additional benefits such as extra votes.

         <h2>WHAT ABOUT SECONDARY MARKET?</h2>
         <p>We will do our best to list on main NFT marketplaces of Solana. Also, we'll take 7% from every sale to fund future project development.</p>
         <h2>WHAT WILL THE TEAM DO WHEN ROADMAP IS DONE?</h2>
         <p>We, developers team, will yield all the control on the project to the officially elected government which will present it's own new roadmap. But, anyway, we'll stay here and will control election process and government funding to avoid rug pull scenarios.</p>
